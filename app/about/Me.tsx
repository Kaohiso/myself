        After completing a foundation in software development and later
        expanding into UX and front-end practices, my path gradually began to
        shift back toward the artistic world that had always lived quietly in
        the background of my life. What started as a technical journey slowly
        unfolded into something more personal: the rediscovery of a passion that
        had shaped my childhood — creating worlds, characters and atmospheres,
        both in 2D and 3D.

        Over time, this creative pull became impossible to ignore. I began
        merging what I had learned through development with a renewed commitment
        to visual expression, shaping a practice that lives between imagination,
        design and digital craft. Today, my focus is to build a body of work
        that explores how ideas evolve when given space, patience and curiosity
        — whether through illustration, modeling, or the quiet process of giving
        form to something that didn’t exist before.

        When I'm not creating or learning new techniques, I spend time outside,
        slowing down, finding calm in fresh air and simple walks — especially
        with my dog, who reminds me daily of the value of presence and small
        moments. This balance between exploration, learning and stillness is
        what continues to guide my work forward.
